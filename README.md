# Authorship-Analyis
This project was based on Authorship Analysis principles. The experiment was done using TF_IDF algorithm and n-gram feature selection. Other features can be extracted but were not extracted for this experiment. This would provide great insight for future work in the field of authorship analysis and potentially code stylomentry. 
The goal of this project was to implement TF_IDF algorithm to extract features from text documents. These features are extracted from the set of known authors to train and test the data.
