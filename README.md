# Authorship-Analyis
This project was based on Authorship Analysis principles. THe experiment was done using TF_IDF algorithm and n-gram feature selection. Other features can be extracted but were not extracted for this experiment. 
The goal of this project was to implement TF_IDF algorithm to extract features from text documents. These features are extracted from the set of known authors to train and test the data.
